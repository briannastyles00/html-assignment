                <h2> Harry Styles Running</h2>

                <p>Harry Styles was seen running alongside the streets of Rome last Friday on an evening jog.
                
                He debuted a new look consisting of a lucious moustache and clear skin from his low-stress quarantine routine. Sporting some casual athletic gear, Styles remains to look like he has stepped out of the 70s with his retro fit look. 
                
                Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Styles, 26, has officially postponed his tour to 2021.It is unclear what his days look like today, but assuming that he won't have to spend hours on end rehersing, let's hope he's taking some time to relax and focus on drafting the frameworks of the next album. </p>

                <h2> Harry Styles was Robbed! of a VMA Nomination </h2>
        
                <img src="https://i.insider.com/5ec2c4f7988ee36ff37741f4?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"/>
            
                <p>On Thursday, MTV announced the 2020 nominations for their Video Music Awards. To the public's surprise, Styles was not among the major categories despite releasing one of the most cohesive pieces of work in the past year.
                
                Styles did however recieve three nominations, but none of those were in the major categories and YES! People are angry! The nominations were in best direction, art direction, and visual effects for "Adore You".
                
                    All I'm sayin is that "Watermelon Sugar" and "Lights Up" deserved better. MTV will pay for this. Please sign our Go-Fund Me to overthrow MTV. </p>

                <h2> Harry Styles Was Actually Robbed this Time!!</h2>
        
                <img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/23/arts/23billboard-item/23billboard-item-superJumbo.jpg"/>
            
                <p>Harry Styles was actually robbed a couple months ago and the worst part was that it was on Valentine's Day. While out walking in his London neighborhood after being at a friend's house, a group of men were standing on a street and looked suspicious. Styles then crossed the street to avoid them and they followed him!!!! Styles then turned off his music and started to panic internally. They started talking to him and Styles was obligated to give them the cash he had on him--you know, because they were threatening him. They wanted him to unlock his phone and give it to them, but Styles refused because he had just built a new world on his mobile Micecraft server and he didn't want to rebuild the entire Disneyland replica he made. He then saw a car and decided to make a run for it. The men couldn't keep up because Styles has the same power that Dash from The Incredibles has. Styles made it home safetly and is alive today to tell his brave story.
